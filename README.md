# Startup Upvote

## The purpose of your application 
 I want an app in which users can post their startup and other users can upvote them


## About your application
With Contember, we will build a web application where users can post their startup ideas and other users can upvote them. The application will have a user interface for creating and viewing startup posts, as well as a voting system for users to express their interest in different startups. The application will be built using Contember's GraphQL API and will have built-in authentication and authorization features.

## Roles
### User
A User is a registered member of the application who can create and view startup posts, as well as upvote other users' startup ideas.

## User flows
### As user I want to submit new product, fill out name, short description and ad a logo
The user logs in, navigates to the "Submit New Product" page, fills out the name and short description fields, uploads a logo, and clicks the "Submit" button to add the product to the platform.
### As user I want to see all products and give upvotes to them
The user logs in, navigates to the "All Products" page, browses through the listed products, and clicks the "Upvote" button next to the products they want to support.
### As user I want to see the total number of upvotes for each product
The user logs in, navigates to the "All Products" page, and views the total number of upvotes displayed next to each product on the list.
